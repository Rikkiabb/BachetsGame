Bachet’s game is probably known to all but probably not by this name. Initially there are n stones on the table. 
There are two players Stan and Ollie, who move alternately. Stan always starts. The legal moves consist in removing at least 
one but not more than k stones from the table. The winner is the one to take the last stone. Here we consider a variation of 
this game. The number of stones that can be removed in a single move must be a member of a certain set of m numbers. 
Among the m numbers there is always 1 and thus the game never stalls.

Input
The input consists of a number of lines. Each line describes one game by a sequence of positive numbers. 
The first number is n≤1000000 the number of stones on the table; the second number is m≤10 giving the number of numbers that 
follow; the last m numbers on the line specify how many stones can be removed from the table in a single move.

Output
For each line of input, output one line saying either Stan wins or Ollie wins assuming that both of them play perfectly.
